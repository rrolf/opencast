    <h1>X5gon User-Tracking Information</h1>

    <p>This page uses the software <a href="https://www.x5gon.org/">X5gon</a>. With this software Open Educational
      Ressources (OER) can be found and indexed.</p>
    <p>Additionally information will be collected to created individualized recommendations of OER for the current user</p>

    <p>To search OERs with X5gon, you can use this site: <a href"https://platform.x5gon.org/search">https://platform.x5gon.org/search</a></p>

    <p>The code on this site submits this data to the X5gon servers:
      <ul>
        <li><b>userId</b>: This attribute identifies which user is accessing the OER material. It
will be created on the X5GON Platform; the id is going to be of the following
format: randomNumberXtimestamp. A typical example will look like
something like this: 41731408528951275X1524236028520. This id creation
method will ensure no one (including us) will be able to identify the user
directly. But it will be sufficient for us to save his or her activity data over
sessions, which will be used for creating personalized recommendations.</li>
        <li><b>materialURL</b>: This value is the material identifier and the link which the user
visited. It will be used to acquire the material and within the recommendation
engine and learning analytics. The acquired material will be enriched and the
found enrichment metadata will be stored in the X5GON platform database –
the material will NOT be stored. Next, when we recommend materials to the
user, the URL will be used as the link to direct the user to the material of
interest.</li>
        <li><b>referrerURL</b>: This URL is the link from which the user arrived to the material.
It will be used to analyse user learning patterns and to recommend them to
other users if it turns out they were insightful.</li>
        <li><b>accessDate</b>: The date at which the material accessed. This information helps
          us to create timelines and determine if users change their interests.</li>
        <li><b>userAgents</b>: This attribute will contain the information about the technology
the user used to access the material. Due to the large usage of bots we will
use this information to determine and validate which request or access of the
material was done by the user and doesn’t correspond to a crawling bot –
removing noise from the activity data.</li>
        <li><b>location</b>: The IP address of the user – which will be used to acquire the
location of the user. The location can be used to adapt to cultural interests
which can be geographically influenced. The user IP will NOT be stored in our
database while the extracted location will be stored and used in our analysis.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
